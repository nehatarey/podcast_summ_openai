For the good and bad. It's true, yeah. Yeah. So it looks like some of the biggest names in music are all making the same change at the same time. They are dumping their very high profile manager.

So that was Liam's fellow Canadian, a fresh-faced 15-year-old Justin Bieber. Baby Bebs. Singing his hit song, Baby. Yeah, just a little Baby Bebs, you know? This song helped establish him as a pop superstar. And just two years before that, he was discovered by Scooter Braun, which I always thought it was just Usher who discovered him. Me too. I actually looked this up. I was like, no, Usher. It's Usher. Well, I guess they co-owned the company. Well, Usher had a meeting with Scooter and Justin when he saw the video or whatever. Because he was like, I met with his manager. And I was like, oh, so Scooter was first in this history. Yeah. So this was after, of course, Justin became a viral sensation on YouTube. He was singing cover songs. And Justin has been repped by Scooter ever since then. And the Bebs has actually been so loyal to Scooter that he even stuck by his side during all the Taylor Swift drama. In case anyone doesn't remember that, in 2019 Scooter bought the Masters to all of Taylor's music, which is why she's releasing Taylor's version now of all of those songs. She is playing checkers while he's playing Monopoly. That's not how that goes. But you get the point. Yeah, yeah, totally. So at the time, Justin publicly defended Scooter. But now there are rumors that Justin might be singing a different tune about old Scoots. Yeah. So on Friday, Puck News reported that Justin dropped Scooter as his manager. And a source told them that Scooter and Justin haven't spoken for months, with another source telling people that it's actually almost been a full year. Now this is especially interesting considering Justin's reportedly been working on a new album for the past six months under the umbrella of Scooter's management. So of course, you know, those in the Bebs are like, this is mean for money. What do I owe people if I leave in the middle? But the source told people that Scooter and his management company, SB Projects, have not set up one session or done one thing for this new record. And that Justin's relationship with Scooter has run its course. Now, neither Justin or Scooter have directly commented on these reports and multiple sources have strongly denied it. But Puck News is like, no, it's true. We swear. Listen to us. We have these anonymous sources. But Puck News is saying that both Scooter and Justin's lawyers are involved. And Puck News did also report that Justin had recently signed a new management deal with Scooter, but it hasn't been revealed how much time is left on that contract. Yeah. So, you know, it may be easy to be like, oh, Justin's leaving Scooter. It's just a one-off. But sure, it looks like this might be the tip of the iceberg. On Monday, news broke that Demi Lovato had also dropped Scooter. And then later that same day, it was reported that Ariana Grande was also dropping Scooter. And we were all like, what? Yeah. We're looking at a mass exodus similar to toilet paper during the pandemic. People are dropping. That was rough. Yeah. But yeah, Demi signed with Scooter back in 2019. And according to Billboard, she dropped him sometime last month. Although, according to the outlet, the departure was amicable. And a source told Billboard it was time for Demi to go in a new direction, even though she was thankful for her time with SB Projects. Now, for Ariana, she's been with Scooter since 2013. These are such long relationships. Yeah. It's 10 years. And she's apparently also leaving on good terms. According to a source who spoke with People, Ariana and Scooter are friendly, but she's outgrown him and is excited to go in a different direction. Yes, there are negotiations happening because of contracts, but this is her choice. It's time for something new. But the intel on whether Ariana and Justin Bieber, for that matter, are really leaving Scooter is a little muddy. And there are conflicting statements flying around. Some sources have told Variety that the rumors are simply not true and that they actually aren't leaving the company and that Scooter is simply stepping back from day to day management to focus on his role as CEO of HYBE America. Yeah. Who doesn't give so many shits about HYBE America? Talk about it every day. Yeah. I mean, I would definitely stop managing these hugely successful people to head up HYBE America. Yeah. With a name like that, you're going to the stars. I mean, yeah. So it isn't totally clear, like we said, where Justin and Ariana stand with Scooter, but it looks like Demi is not the only celebrity who's officially parting ways with him. It was just reported yesterday that Idina Menzel, some may know her as Adele Dazeem, of course. Yeah. Adele Dazeem. Love her music. And J Balvin. Yeah. Also recently dropped Scooter as their manager. And of course, like we said, this has led to a lot of online speculation about what the hell is going on here. Like, yeah, mostly in my Instagram stories yesterday, I was like, what's going on? That's a case wide open. But Scooter is laughing the whole thing off. Yeah. So yesterday he poked fun at the whole situation on the site, formerly known as Twitter. He said, breaking news, I'm no longer managing myself. So maybe he's about to start a comedy career. I was just going to say. Who knows? Maybe that's what this is all about. Yeah. HYBE comedy. But one source told Variety that this is no laughing matter and that Scooter is imploding. That source even suggested that it's due to his behavior. They said it's a different world since the pandemic. You can't just be an asshole like that anymore. Which you shouldn't have been one in the first place. I was going to say, like, never should you be an asshole. Yeah. Yeah. Before COVID, it was like, just be an asshole. Yeah. Willy nilly. No one cares. You're fine. Do whatever you want. So it's important to note that the source never gets into specifics on what Scooter has allegedly done. But again, we're also hearing another version of the story. A different source told Variety that the real story here is that Scooter is simply getting out of management. Yeah. And that source was Scooter in a mask. Well, I was like, if that was the story, then why wouldn't everyone that's leaving say that? Like, I know. That's such an innocuous story. Like, oh, Scooter is transitioning out of management. He doesn't want to do management anymore. So we're moving on. Like, it's just they know there's going to be a lot of speculation, which makes me pretty sure there's something. There's something brewing that's not going to be good. I know. So that's my question. Like, what is your gut feeling about this? Like, there's no way it's just that he's leaving. And if that is the story, I'm so mad. I will write it. I want a scandal. I mean, there's just there's no way I have dedicated a good few hours of my life over the past few days. Going down Reddit rabbit holes, trying to find any kind of like hints about what this could be about. I keep seeing Taylor Swift's lyrics getting thrown around, the one where she says, well, he was doing lines and crossing all of mine. Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI. So maybe this is a case for the FBI. Oh, no. Yeah. But I just I feel like this is like we were just saying, like if it was something as simple as I want to focus on something else. Why? If you especially if you have these relationships with him, like they've all been with. They've all been with him for years. Right. Seemingly amicable, as they're all saying in their splits. Why would that be what you say? I know there's literally nothing to hide. But the fact that you're not being forthcoming. Right. There's something that's being hidden. Yeah. I mean, they were like, can we just say a reconcilable differences? And they were like, no, you can't use that. The force only. You're not allowed. Yeah. This I mean, selfishly, I was like, I hope this is a scandal so we can do an E.T.R. miniseries about it. I get it on the ground floor. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, there's I mean, come on. This is showbiz. No one believes that I'm just getting out of it. Like these people he's he's obviously a good manager. Like these people's careers skyrocketed, you know. So there's got to be something going on. Nobody's like, yeah, I'm sick of money. So we're just going to part ways like come on. Maybe he's one of those, you know, really altruistic rich people. And he's like, I've reached the top. I'm going to start just giving it away. I don't need any more share the wealth. Yep. Based on everything I've heard about, that does seem clear. Well, this is post pandemic. Maybe he had a lobotomy and just completely changed his whole persona. You know. Yeah. Yeah. This is Scooter's version. Oh, I would never download that ever. Same. Same.
