I'm Devin and here are the three biggest stories from tabletop gaming from the past week in 10 minutes or less so you can get back to playing the game We have lots of news coming out of Wizards of the Coast this week in Hasbro First off we're going to talk about Hasbro CEO Chris Cox who in an investor call this past week Talked about the future of D&D and how that's going to lie in digital Wizards of the Coast is going to continue to move into the digital space and not just with their new VTT That they're planning to release in 2024 Dungeons & Dragons and Wizards of the Coast believe that the future of D&D lies within gaming and of course the past week of success from the release of Boulders Gate 3 has definitely shown that to be the case Wizards of the Coast plans to be releasing more into the video game market With AAA games, mobile games, etc. Now, of course, this is a great move But the most interesting thing for me that came out of that call is Chris Cox talked about the total addressable market of tabletop Role-playing games in that call Estimating it being around 80 million people the quote was him talking about how they want to take the 80 million TAM that they have currently in the tabletop role-playing game hobby and Expand that into the 800 million TAM of video games We all know video games are massive and the industry is huge. In fact, it's bigger than movies television and music Combined in fact, it looks like Hasbro made more money off the licensing deal with Boulders Gate 3 than any of their movie properties That they have licensed that's more than transformers. That's huge So what this means is we're gonna see more video games coming from Wizards of the Coast Of course, we know that Hidden Path Entertainment is also working on a AAA game for Wizards of the Coast and Dungeons & Dragons I'm really excited to see what comes out from that the future of D&D as far as Wizards of the Coast is concerned is digital This past week we also saw critical roles Taldori Reborn show up on D&D Beyond This is massive because this is the first time since D&D Beyond's sale to Wizards of the Coast that we've seen Third-party content on D&D Beyond before there was some League of Legends content when fandom owned it But now we are seeing the first step in opening up D&D Beyond to third-party content Now the book contains the setting guide plus player content like subclasses and is published in physical form through Darrington Press While it might be easy to see why Wizards of the Coast would make a deal with critical role It's still very interesting development after the more exclusive take on third-party content seen earlier this year I do think that this is the first step in seeing D&D Beyond begin to support third-party content We do know that D&D Beyond and Wizards of the Coast has hoped to kind of build a marketplace for third-party content Kind of like exactly what they did for creators in the DMs guild But this would be for a player in the Game Master side a place to house and use all that content with their digital tools Wizards of the Coast hopes to continue to grow that user base for D&D Beyond and Providing a marketplace for third-party creators is the likely next step And Our last story the current D&D team does say that they want to revisit spelljammer and Eberron There's been a lot of criticism around Wizards of the Coast and how they've been releasing new settings for D&D Specifically spelljammer was incredibly light and people felt that it just wasn't a holistic approach To presenting the new setting a lot of folks were hoping that spelljammer would have more content similar to the Eberron release But a recent talk with Jeremy Crawford in comicbook.com Jeremy Crawford said with the multiverse kind of expanding inside D&D They feel that this is a prime opportunity to revisit those settings with Jeremy Crawford specifically being quoted that they look forward to returning to them and they want to stagger such releases so that players have time to actually Use the books in their collection And lastly it looks like we're going to have another huge surge of interest in D&D with Baldur's Gate 3 and its massive success with IGN giving it a 10 out of 10. It looks like it could be a Fantastic contender for game of the year. Baldur's Gate 3 thousands of hours of play There is so much content coming out so many moments of surprise and delight that people are experiencing There has been a huge uptick in search terms about how to get into D&D after this game's release Doing exactly what Netflix did for Dungeons and Dragons with Stranger Things We're seeing that happen again with Baldur's Gate 3 and that is a perfect time to talk about this week's sponsor Start playing dot games start playing dot games is a platform to help you find games groups in Game Masters Start playing is a fantastic resource if you're looking to get into D&D or just find your weekly campaign Start playing allows you to look through games that fit your schedule You can even read reviews of the different game masters on the site So you can make sure you find one that fits your play style And if you want to go ahead and sign with a link below in the description That link will give you $10 in credit for your first game on start playing.

It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force. Jeffrey Burton Russell states that the different conceptions of the devil can be summed up as 1) a principle of evil independent from God, 2) an aspect of God, 3) a created being turning evil (a fallen angel), and 4) a symbol of human evil.:\u200a23\u200aEach tradition, culture, and religion with a devil in its mythos offers a different lens on manifestations of evil. The history of these perspectives intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art, and literature developing independently within each of the traditions. It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names\u2014Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, Iblis\u2014and attributes: it is portrayed as blue, black, or red; it is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on. While depictions of the devil are usually taken seriously, there are times when it is treated less seriously; when, for example, devil figures are used in advertising and on candy wrappers.", "podcast_highlights": "- Hasbro CEO Chris Cox discusses the future of D&D and its focus on digital gaming\n- Wizards of the Coast plans to release more video games, like Boulders Gate 3, to expand their market\n- D&D Beyond introduces third-party content for the first time, signaling a shift towards supporting third-party creators\n- The D&D team expresses interest in revisiting the spelljammer and Eberron settings\n- Baldur's Gate 3's success leads to a surge of interest in D&D and potential game of the year status\n- Sponsorship by Start Playing, a platform to find games groups and Game Masters"}
